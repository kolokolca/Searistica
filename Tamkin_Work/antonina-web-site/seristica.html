								<h3>Seristica:</h3>

								<p>Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), in particular gliders, have been used for
								many tasks such as underwater surveys. Modern-day gliders can perform month-long missions.
								During a mission, several factors impact their performance: ocean currents, lack of
								communication and GPS while under water, weather. At present engineers do not seem to
								do much mission planning, supplying a glider with a list of goals created by hand. Developing
								techniques for planning such missions for possibly heterogeneous groups of gliders
								is the goal of this project.
								</p>
								<p>At the heart of such mission planning problem are variants of the Asymmetric Traveling
								Salesman problem: as it is NP-hard, there is no known algorithm to solve it exactly in
								polynomial time. However, over the last decade heuristic solvers, in particular solvers
								based on Integer Linear Programming and Satisfiability, have been used successfully in
								practice to solve industrial instances of many NP-hard problems.</p>
								<p>In this project we will describe a glider mission planner that we developed, which is
								based on using such solvers. We evaluate performance of generic solvers, in particular we
								used a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver CPLEX, several Pseudo-Boolean
								Optimization (PBO) solvers Sat4j, Clasp, SCIP and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
								solver Z3 as the core engine of our planner. The performance of finding a optimal mission
								plan also heavily depends on the type of encodings. In addition to different solvers, we
								analyzed several types of encodings, from the classic Miller, Tucker and Zemlin encoding
								to Fox, Gavish and Gravesâ€™ time-dependent TSP encoding. In our experiments, Mixed
								Integer Linear Programming solver (MILP) has been the most successful compare to other
								types of generic solvers.</p>
								<p>An important question in satisfiability heuristic solver research is modelling the realworld
								instances by a synthetic distribution. Here, we compared the performance of the
								solvers on instances of ATSP coming from ocean current data with their performance on
								crafted instance of random graphs, Euclidean graphs and Euclidean with varying amounts
								of noise, both symmetric and asymmetric. Developing techniques for planning such mission
								was the goal of this project, and in this thesis we describe and evaluate several approaches
								to AUV mission planning problem. <a target="_blank" href="" class="more">See more</a>  </p>
