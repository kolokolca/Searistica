##### Pseudo Boolean Encoding, this encoding tested on SAT4j PB solver.
* InstantceGenerator.py can generate random problem instanse, It randomly creates a shortest path to varify optimal result found by SAT4j PB solver
* It generates PBEncoding.opb file which can used to as a  input file for the solver
* run as : java -jar sat4j-pb.jar PBEncoding.opb
* TSP_PS_Current.opb is manually generated problem instance having 4 nodes
